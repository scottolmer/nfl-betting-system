## 💡 SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY

**What Makes It Elite:**
1. **Multi-dimensional** - 8 different perspectives
2. **Quantified** - Confidence scores (0-100)
3. **Position-specific** - WR1 vs WR1, not just "WR"
4. **Real-time** - Live monitoring with context
5. **Optimal** - Mathematical parlay construction
6. **Automated** - Instant alerts and analysis
7. **Integrated** - Everything in Slack

---

## 🚨 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

**Check in order:**
1. Are all 3 terminals running?
2. Using enhanced versions? (not old files)
3. Is .env correct? (API keys, week number)
4. Are data files present for current week?
5. Is ngrok URL updated in Slack?

**Run diagnostics:**
```bash
python scripts\test_merged_system.py
```
