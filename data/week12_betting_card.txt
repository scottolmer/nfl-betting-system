💡 BETTING TIPS
============================================================
• 2-leg parlays have highest hit rate but lower payout
• 3-leg and 4-leg balance risk/reward
• 5-leg is high risk/high reward - consider reducing units
• Same-game parlays have correlation bonus but higher variance
• Uncorrelated parlays (different games) are safer
• Position diversity reduces correlation risk
• Never bet more than you can afford to lose!
